# Steps to Complete the Secretos.com Backend

## **5. Develop Core Features**

1. **Secrets**

   - Implement endpoints to create, retrieve, update, and delete secrets.
   - Add a like/unlike feature for secrets.

2. **Users**
   - Implement endpoints to manage user profiles.
   - Add functionality to retrieve user-specific data.

---

## **6. Add Middleware**

- **Error Handling Middleware:** Centralize error handling across the app.
- **Rate Limiting Middleware:** Use middleware to prevent abuse of API endpoints.

---

## **7. Add Pagination and Filtering**

- Implement pagination for list endpoints (e.g., retrieving secrets).
- Add query parameters for filtering and sorting results.

---

## **8. Enhance Security**

- Sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- Use `helmet` to secure HTTP headers.
- Implement CORS policies to restrict access from unauthorized origins.

---

## **9. Integrate Swagger Documentation**

- Define detailed Swagger documentation for all API endpoints.
- Include descriptions, request/response examples, and error codes.

---

## **10. Write Tests**

- Write unit tests for controllers, services, and routes.
- Write integration tests for end-to-end validation of API behavior.

---

## **11. Add Logging and Monitoring**

- Add logging with `winston` or `pino` for debugging and operational insights.
- Monitor API performance with tools like `pm2`.

---

## **12. Optimize and Finalize**

- Test the API locally and handle edge cases.
- Optimize database queries (e.g., indexing).
- Clean up unused code and dependencies.

---

## **13. Deploy**

- Choose a hosting provider (e.g., AWS, Heroku, Vercel).
- Set up a production MongoDB instance (e.g., MongoDB Atlas).
- Deploy the application and test it in a live environment.

---

## **14. Maintain and Iterate**

- Monitor the production environment for issues.
- Collect user feedback to improve features and add new functionality.
