# Steps to Create Frontend for Secretos.com with Vite and React

## 3. **Set Up Routing**

- Use React Router for client-side routing.
- Define routes for core pages like:
  - `/` (Home)
  - `/login` (Login)
  - `/signup` (Signup)
  - `/profile/:id` (User Profile)
  - `/secrets/:id` (Secret Details)
- Configure protected routes for authenticated users.

## 4. **Implement Authentication Flow**

- Create an **AuthContext** for managing authentication state.
- Build login and signup forms.
- Handle JWT storage in localStorage or cookies.
- Include logic for refreshing tokens if applicable.
- Redirect users based on authentication state.

## 5. **Build Core Features**

### Secrets Feed

- Fetch secrets from the backend and display them.
- Include pagination or infinite scrolling for scalability.
- Allow users to like, comment, and view details of secrets.

### Profile Page

- Display user information and their secrets.
- Allow profile updates and viewing follower/following lists.

### Posting Secrets

- Create a form for posting secrets (with isAnon option).
- Validate content length and sanitize input.

### Likes and Comments

- Integrate like/unlike functionality.
- Display and add comments on secrets.

## 6. **Global State Management**

- Use Context API or Redux Toolkit for managing global state.
- Store user data, authentication state, and UI state globally.
- Use slices (if Redux Toolkit) for modular state management.

## 7. **Implement Reusable Components**

- Design components like:
  - Buttons (primary, secondary).
  - Input fields and forms.
  - Modal dialogs.
  - Secret card (displays a secret's content, likes, and comments).

## 8. **Styling and Responsiveness**

- Use a CSS framework (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Material-UI) or write custom CSS/SCSS.
- Implement mobile-first design for responsive layouts.
- Create a consistent design system for colors, typography, and spacing.

## 9. **API Integration**

- Create service functions in the **services** folder for backend communication.
- Example services:
  - `authService.js`: Login, signup, token refresh.
  - `secretService.js`: Fetch, create, delete secrets.
  - `userService.js`: Fetch user profile, update profile.
- Use Axios interceptors to handle JWT in headers.

## 10. **Testing**

- Write unit tests for components and utility functions using Jest.
- Use React Testing Library for testing UI interactions.
- Perform end-to-end testing with tools like Cypress.

## 11. **Error Handling and Notifications**

- Show error messages for API failures.
- Create a notification/toast system for feedback (e.g., success, error messages).
- Handle edge cases like expired tokens or network failures.

## 12. **Optimize Performance**

- Lazy-load components and routes where applicable.
- Use React's memoization (e.g., `React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`) to optimize re-renders.
- Optimize API calls using caching or data fetching libraries (e.g., React Query).

## 13. **Deploy the Frontend**

- Configure the app for deployment.
- Use Vite's build output (`dist/` folder) for production.
- Deploy to a platform like Vercel, Netlify, or your own hosting solution.
- Set up environment variables for API URLs.

## 14. **Iterate and Enhance**

- Gather user feedback to prioritize improvements.
- Add new features based on user needs (e.g., secret sharing, notifications).
- Continuously refactor for better performance and maintainability.
